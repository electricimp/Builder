# About Builder #

Builder combines a preprocessor with an expression language and advanced imports.

There are a number of ways in which you can [install Builder](#builder-installation) depending on how you plan to integrate it into your workflow. Once installed on your computer, you can use it to process your Squirrel application and factory firmware before you transfer the code to an impCentral™ Device Group.

**Note** The [Electric Imp VS Code extension](https://github.com/electricimp/vscode) already incorporates Builder and can be used to upload code to Device Groups. If you are using the VS Code extension, there is no need install Builder separately to take advantage of its features.

You can use Builder to pull the contents of separate code files into your main source code files. These additional files might contain library code that you make use of across a number of different products, or they might contain confidential data which you don’t want to keep inside source code files that are managed through a software version control system.

You tell Builder which files to import, and where within your main source code they should be inserted, by using the [`@include`](#include) command. Builder is able to [access additional files](#include-files) that are stored on your computer or held remotely on an external resource (eg. HTTP/HTTPs server or a repository).

While Builder can be used to insert code this way, it can be used in far more sophisticated ways thanks to its integrated expression processor and programming logic. For example, if you need to generate multiple versions of your application firmware for versions of your product which make use of different imp modules, you can use Builder’s [conditional execution features](#if-elif-else), [variables](#variables) and [loops](#while) to pull your various code components together at build time and output files that are ready to be transferred to impCentral.

To speed up the process, [files that are stored remotely](#remote-include-files) which are not expected to change between builds can be cached for quick re-use. Builder's [reproducible artifacts](#reproducible-artifacts) feature makes it possible to store references to all files and variables, so that builds can be re-created for future debugging.

For details on the commands that Builder offers, please see the [Directives](#directives) section. This is part of the [Builder Syntax](#builder-syntax) section, which also describes how Builder commands are structured.

# Builder Installation #

Builder requires Node.js 8.0.0 and above. It can be installed and used by two ways:

- As an [_npm_ command line tool](#command-line-tool-installation)
- As an [_npm_ library](#library-installation).

## Command Line Tool Installation ##

Install Builder:

```sh
npm install -g Builder
```

Now use Builder’s `pleasebuild` command to configure the newly installed utility:

```sh
pleasebuild [-l] [-D<variable> <value>]
    [--github-user <username> --github-token <token>] [--azure-user <username> --azure-token <token>]
    [--bitbucket-server-addr <address>] [--bitbucket-server-user <username> --bitbucket-server-token <token>]
    [--lib <path_to_file>] [--use-remote-relative-includes] [--suppress-duplicate-includes-warning]
    [--cache] [--clear-cache] [--cache-exclude-list <path_to_file>]
    [--save-dependencies [<path_to_file>]] [--use-dependencies [<path_to_file>]]
    [--save-directives [<path_to_file>]] [--use-directives [<path_to_file>]]
    <input_file>
```

where `<input_file>` is the path to source file which should be preprocessed and the other options are:

| Option | Synonym | Mandatory? | Value&nbsp;Required? | Description |

console.log(result);
```

To understand Builder configuration, please review [this source code](./src/cli.js).

# Builder Syntax #

## Expressions ##

### Types ###

The following value types are supported in expressions:

- *numbers* (eg. `1`, `1E6`, `1e-6`, `1.567`)
- *strings* (eg. `"abc"`, `'abc'`)
- *booleans* (eg. `true`, `false`)
- `null`

### Operators ###

Builder supports the following operators:

#### Binary ####

`||`&nbsp;&nbsp;`&&`&nbsp;&nbsp;`==`&nbsp;&nbsp;`!=`&nbsp;&nbsp;`<`&nbsp;&nbsp;`>`&nbsp;&nbsp;`<=`&nbsp;&nbsp;`>=`&nbsp;&nbsp;`+`&nbsp;&nbsp;`-`&nbsp;&nbsp;`*`&nbsp;&nbsp;`/`&nbsp;&nbsp;`%`

#### Unary ####

`+`&nbsp;&nbsp;`-`&nbsp;&nbsp;`!`

### Member Expressions ###

Membership of an object is expressed using any of the following expressions:

- `somevar.member`
- `somevar["member"]`
- `([1, 2, 3])[1]`

### Conditional Expressions ###

Builder provides the standard ternary operator (`?:`) for evaluating basic conditions:

`<condition> ? <if_condition_true> : <if_condition_false>`

### Variables ###

Variables can be used in Builder expressions. Variable names can contain `$`, `_`, latin letters and digits, however they must not start with a digit. Variables can be defined in the following ways:

- Builder's [`@set`](#set) directive.
- Your computer's [environment variables](#environment-variables).
- Pass the option `-D<variable name> <variable value>` to Builder’s [`pleasebuild`](#command-line-tool-installation) command.

All undefined variables are evaluated as `null`.

#### Variable Definition Order ####

When resolving a variable’s value:

1. Builder looks for its definition among the command line parameters (as `-D<variable name> <variable value>`) passed to the [`pleasebuild`](#command-line-tool-installation) command.
2. If no such variable definition is found, the code is scanned for [`@set`](#set) directive statements preceding the variable usage.
3. If no variable definitions are found in the previous steps, Builder looks in the host environment variables.

#### Environment Variables ####

There is no special predicate required to make use of environment variables. Builder looks in the host environment variables to try and resolve the expressions if no command line or local variables have been set.

For example, on a Mac:

```squirrel
server.log("Host home path is @{HOME}");
```

will print the home directory path of the current user of the system where Builder was executed.

Environment variables differ based on OS. If you wish to use environment variables with Builder, a quick internet search will give you details on how to *list* the variables currently available on your system and also how to *set* new variables.

#### Builder Variables ####

Builder provides the following pre-defined variables:

- `__LINE__` &mdash; The line number (relative to the file in which this variable appears). For example:

    `Hi from line @{__LINE__}!`
- `__FILE__` &mdash; The name of the file in which this variable appears. For example:

    `Hi from file @{__FILE__}!`
- `__PATH__` &mdash; The absolute path (not including file name) to the file where this variable appears. Can contain a URL for remote includes. For example:

    `Hi from file @{__PATH__}!`
    
-  `__REPO_PREFIX__` &mdash; The root of the repository resource which is being processed. Is an internal variable of Builder. For example:

    `github:electricimp/Builder`
    
-  `__REPO_REF__` &mdash; The git reference (branch name or tag) of the repository resource which is being processed. Is an internal variable of Builder.

-  `__URL_ROOT__` &mdash; The root of the remote weblink resource which is being processed. Is an internal variable of Builder. For example:
<pre>
    https://example.com
    http://example.com:8080</pre>
    
-  `__URL_PATH__` &mdash; The path to the file on the remote weblink resource which is being processed, relative to the root of resource. Is an internal variable of Builder.

<a id="loopvars"></a>

Builder has two directives [`@while`](#while) and [`@repeat`](#repeat) for managing loops. Inside these loops the following variables are available:

- `loop.index` &mdash; 0-indexed iteration counter
- `loop.iteration` &mdash; 1-indexed iteration counter

Usage examples for these variables can be found in the [`@while`](#while) and [`@repeat`](#repeat) directive examples.

### Builder Functions ###

Builder provides the following helper functions:

- `defined(<variable_name>)` &mdash; returns `true` if a variable is defined, `false` otherwise.
- `include(<source>)` &mdash; includes external source.
- `escape(<value>)` &mdash; escapes special characters in string (`\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`,  `\`, `'`, `"`).
- `base64(<value>)` &mdash; encodes value as base64.
- `min(<numbers>)` &mdash; returns a number equal to the lowest number in the supplied list.
- `max(<numbers>)` &mdash; returns a number equal to the highest number in the supplied list.
- `abs(<number>)` &mdash; returns the absolute value of the supplied number.

Builder also comes with some string functions, based on the JavaScript methods of the same names. These functions are available under the namespace `S`. The first argument of each function is always the string to be operated on. For documentation on the remaining arguments, please see [‘JavaScript String Methods’](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).

- `S.concat()`
- `S.endsWith()`
- `S.includes()`
- `S.repeat()`
- `S.split()`
- `S.startsWith()`
- `S.substr()`
- `S.substring()`
- `S.toLowerCase()`
- `S.toUpperCase()`
- `S.trim()`
- `S.trimLeft()`
- `S.trimRight()`

## Comments ##

Lines starting with `@` followed by space or a line break are treated as comments and not added to the output. For example:

```
@ This is a Builder comment and will not appear in the output
```

Any text following `//` and extending to the end of the line will be ignored by Builder* and will not appear in the result output. For example:

```
@set SOME_STRING = "my string" // This is a Builder comment that will not appear in output
```

## Directives ##

All of Builder’s directives start with the `@` symbol. Don’t include a space or line break between the `@` and the required directive’s name as this will be interpreted as a [comment](#comments).

### @{...} Inline Expressions/Macros ###

This directive evaluates the expression enclosed by braces (`{` and  `}`) and inserts the result into the output. The enclosure can be the value of a named variable, an expression or a macro.

<pre>
<b>@{</b><i>&lt;variable:identifier&gt;</i><b>}</b>
<b>@{</b><i>&lt;expression&gt;</i><b>}</b>
<b>@{</b><i>macro(a, b, c)</i><b>}</b>
</pre>

#### Example ####

The line:

```
The result is: @{123 * 456}.
```

results in the following output:

```
The result is: 56088.
```

### @set ###

This directive assigns a value or the value of an expression to a [variable](#variables). Variables are defined in a global context. A value can be any supported [type](#types) or [function](#builder-functions).

<pre>
<b>@set </b><i>&lt;variable:identifier&gt; &lt;value:expression&gt;</i>
<b>@set </b><i>&lt;variable:identifier&gt;</i> <b>=</b> <i>&lt;value:expression&gt;</i>
</pre>

#### Example ####

In this example, we define a number of variables using `@set`, then use [`@{...}`](#-inline-expressionsmacros) to create squirrel log messages with those variables. If the following lines are added to your source code:

```
@ Set Builder global variables
@set SOME_INT    = 10
@set SOME_STRING = "my string"
@set BOOL_VAL    = (12 > 4)
@
@ Use a Builder function to set a global variable
@set MIN_INT min(1, 2, 3)
@
// Use Builder global variables in squirrel log messages
server.log(@{SOME_INT});
server.log("@{SOME_STRING}");
server.log(@{BOOL_VAL});
server.log(@{MIN_INT});
```

then during processing, Builder will output:

```
// Use Builder global variables in squirrel log messages
server.log(10);
server.log("my string");
server.log(true);
server.log(1);
```

### @macro ###

This directive defines a code block with its own parameters. Macros are declared in a global scope. Macro parameters are only available within the macro scope and override global variables with the same name (but do not affect them).

#### Define A Macro ####

<pre>
<b>@macro</b> <i>&lt;name&gt;</i>(<i>&lt;arguments&gt;</i>)
    <i>&lt;body&gt;</i>
<b>@endmacro</b>
</pre>

**Note** `@end` can be used in place of `@endmacro` if you prefer.

#### Use A Macro ####

Macros can be used either inline with the [`@{...}`](#-inline-expressionsmacros) directive, or with the [`@include`](#include) directive. When macros are used inline no line-control statements are generated for the output inside the macro scope and trailing newlines are trimmed from the macro output.

<pre>
<b>@{</b>macro<b>(</b>a, b ,c)<b>}</b>
<b>@include</b> macro(a, b ,c)
</pre>

#### Inline Example ####

Define a macro and use the [`@{...}`](#-inline-expressionsmacros) directive to create a multi-line string to log in squirrel:

```
@ Define a macro
@macro some_macro(a, b, c)
    Hello, @{a}!
    Roses are @{b},
    And violets are @{c}
@end
@
// Use an inline Builder macro to create a multi-line string
poem <- @"@{some_macro("username", "red", "blue")}";
server.log(poem);
```

This results in the following output:

```
// Use an inline Builder macro to create a multi-line string
poem <- @"    Hello, username!
    Roses are red,
    And violets are blue";
server.log(poem);
```

#### Include Example ####

Define a macro and use it with [`@include`](#include) to create a multi-line string to log in squirrel:

```
@ Define a macro
@macro some_macro(a, b, c)
    Hello, @{a}!
    Roses are @{b},
    And violets are @{c}
@end
@
// Use Builder include and macro directives to create a multi-line squirrel string
poem <- @"
@include some_macro("username", "red", "blue")
";
server.log(poem);
```

This results in the following output:

```
// Use Builder include and macro directives to create a multi-line squirrel string
poem <- @"
    Hello, username!
    Roses are red,
    And violets are blue
";
server.log(poem);
```

#### Optional Parameter Example ####

Use a [function](#builder-functions) to configure and use a macro with an optional parameter.

```
@ Define a macro with an optional parameter
@macro some_macro(a, b, c)
    Hello, @{a}!
    Roses are @{b},
    And violets are @{defined(c) ? c : "of undefined color"}.
@end
@
// Use Builder include and macro directives to create a multi-line squirrel string
poem <- @"
@include some_macro("username", "red")
";
server.log(poem);
```

This results in the following output:

```
// Use Builder include and macro directives to create a multi-line squirrel string
poem <- @"
    Hello, username!
    Roses are red,
    And violets are of undefined color.
";
server.log(poem);
```

### @include ###

This directive can be used to include local files, files from remote resources or [macros](#macro).

<pre>
<b>@include</b> <i>&lt;source:expression&gt;</i>
</pre>

- For a [`@macro`](#macro):

    <pre><b>@include</b> some_macro("username", 123)</pre>

- For a local file:

    <pre><b>@include</b> "somepath/somefile.ext"</pre>

- For a file from remote resource:

    <pre><b>@include</b> "someresource/somepath/somefile.ext"</pre>

The **@** character must not be present in the path and name of the file which is being included.

Please see the [Include Files](#include-files) section for information about include formats, file searching rules, supported remote resources, examples and other details.

### @include once ###

This directive acts just like `@include` but has no effect if the specified *source* has already been included. However, macros are always included.

<pre><b>@include once</b> <i>&lt;source:expression&gt;</i></pre>

### @while ###

This directive invokes a loop which only ends when specified conditions are met. You can access Builder’s [loop variables](#loopvars) within `@while` loops.

<pre>
<b>@while</b> <i>&lt;test:expression&gt;</i>
    // 0-based iteration counter: <b>@{</b>loop.index<b>}</b>
    // 1-based iteration counter: <b>@{</b>loop.iteration<b>}</b>
<b>@endwhile</b>
</pre>

**Note** `@end` may be used in place of `@endwhile` if you prefer.

#### Example ####

The following lines, when added to your source code:

```
@set myvar = 12

@while myvar > 9
    @set myvar = myvar - 1
var: @{myvar}
    loop.index: @{loop.index}
    loop.iteration: @{loop.iteration}
@end
```

will output:

```
var: 11
    loop.index: 0
    loop.iteration: 1
var: 10
    loop.index: 1
    loop.iteration: 2
var: 9
    loop.index: 2
    loop.iteration: 3
```

### @repeat ###

This directive invokes a loop that repeats for a certain number of iterations. You can access Builder’s [loop variables](#loopvars) within `@repeat` loops.

<pre>
<b>@repeat</b> <i>&lt;times:expression&gt;</i>
    // 0-based iteration counter: <b>@{</b>loop.index<b>}</b>
    // 1-based iteration counter: <b>@{</b>loop.iteration<b>}</b>
<b>@endrepeat</b>
</pre>

**Note** `@end` may be used in place of `@endrepeat` if you prefer.

#### Example ####

The following lines, when added to your source code:

```
@repeat 3
    loop.index: @{loop.index}
    loop.iteration: @{loop.iteration}

@end
```

will output:

```
    loop.index: 0
    loop.iteration: 1

    loop.index: 1
    loop.iteration: 2

    loop.index: 2
    loop.iteration: 3

```

<a id="if-elif-else"></a>

### @if... @elseif... @else ###

This directive provides conditional branching.

<pre>
<b>@if</b> <i>&lt;test:expression&gt;</i>
    // Consequent code
<b>@elseif</b> <i>&lt;test:expression&gt;</i>
    // else if #1 code
<b>@else</b>
    // Alternative code
<b>@endif</b>
</pre>

**Note** `@end` may be used in place of `@endif` if you prefer.

#### Example ####

```
@if __FILE__ == 'abc.ext'
    // include something
@elseif __FILE__ == 'def.ext'
    // include something else
@else
    // do something completely different
@endif
```

### @error ###

This directive simply emits an error.

<pre>
<b>@error</b> <i>&lt;message:expression&gt;</i>
</pre>

#### Example ####

```
@if PLATFORM == "platform1"
    // platform 1 code
@elseif PLATFORM == "platform2"
    // platform 2 code
@elseif PLATFORM == "platform3"
    // platform 3 code
@else
    @error "Platform " + PLATFORM + " is unsupported"
@endif
```

### @warning ###

This directive simply emits a warning.

<pre>
<b>@warning</b> <i>&lt;message:expression&gt;</i>
</pre>

#### Example ####

```
@if PLATFORM == "platform1"
    // platform 1 code
@elseif PLATFORM == "platform2"
    // platform 2 code
@elseif PLATFORM == "platform3"
    // platform 3 code
@else
    @warning "Building for default platform"
    // default platform code
@endif
```

## Filters ##

The filter operator, `|`, allows you to pass a value through any of the supported [functions](#builder-functions).

<pre>
<b>@{</b>&lt;expression&gt;</i> | <i>&lt;filter&gt;</i><b>}</b>
</pre>

This is equivalent to:

<pre>
<b>@{</b><i>&lt;filter&gt;(&lt;expression&gt;)</i><b>}</b>
</pre>

#### Example ####

```
// Include external HTML piped through the escape processing function
a = "@{include('index.html')|escape}"

// Include an external binary piped through the base64 encoder function
b = "@{include('file.bin')|base64}"
```

# Include Files #

This section contains detailed information about usage of the [`@include`](#include) and [`@include once`](#include-once) directives to include local or remote files.

**Local file** is a file on the same system where *Builder* is running.

**Remote file** is a file on a remote resource (eg. a repository or a HTTP/HTTPs server). See the [Remote Include Files](#remote-include-files) section for the list of supported remote resources.

The file mentioned in the [`@include`](#include) or [`@include once`](#include-once) directives may contain a **relative** or an **absolute path**.

##### Examples: #####

```
@include "https://example.com/somefile.ext" // absolute path to remote file
@include once "github:electricimp/Promise/promise.class.nut" // absolute path to remote file
@include "c:\somefolder\somefile.ext" // absolute path to local file
@include once "./somefile.ext" // relative path
@include "somefile.ext" // relative path
```

The next section clarifies how *Builder* searches the included file.

## Searching The Included File ##

**Processed file** is a file currently being processed by *Builder*, it can be local or remote, it contains the [`@include`](#include) or [`@include once`](#include-once) directive(s).

**Path to the processed file** is an absolute path to the processed file.

**Path in the include** is the path mentioned in the [`@include`](#include) or [`@include once`](#include-once) directive, it can be an absolute path to local file, an absolute path to remote file or a relative path.

**Full path to the include file** is an absolute path to the file which will be included by *Builder*.

The below rules define how *Builder* searches the included file:

### Absolute Path To Remote File ###

If the path in the include is an absolute path to the remote file, it is considered as the final path to the include file. If the file is not found there, *Builder* reports an error.

##### Examples: #####
```
@include "https://example.com/somefile.ext" // absolute path to remote file
@include once "github:electricimp/Promise/promise.class.nut" // absolute path to remote file
```

### Absolute Path To Local File ###

If the path in the include is an absolute path to the local file, it is considered as the final path to the include file. If the file is not found there, *Builder* reports an error.

##### Examples: #####
```
@include "c:\somefolder\somefile.ext" // absolute path to local file
@include "/home/user/someuser/somefolder/somefile.ext" // absolute path to local file. But see the note below.
```

**Note**: Under some conditions a path in the include which starts from the "**/**" symbol is processed by the special rule described below.

### "/" As Root Of Remote Resource ###

If

- the first symbol of the path in the include is "**/**" 
- and the processed file is a remote file (ie. the file on a remote resource) 
- and the `--use-remote-relative-includes` option is specified

then the final path to the include file is a concatenation of the root of remote resource and the path in the include. If the file is not found there, *Builder* reports an error. See the [Remote Include Files](#remote-include-files) section for the root definition of the supported remote resources.

##### Examples: #####
```
The processed file: "https://example.com/folderA/folderB/somefile.nut"

It contains:
@include "/folderC/anotherfile.nut"

The final path to the include: "https://example.com/folderC/anotherfile.nut"
```

```
The processed file: "github:someuser/somerepo/folderA/folderB/somefile.nut@develop"

It contains:
@include "/folderC/anotherfile.nut"

The final path to the include: "github:someuser/somerepo/folderC/anotherfile.nut@develop"
```

### Relative Path To Remote File ###

If

- the path in the include is a relative path 
- and the processed file is a remote file (ie. the file on a remote resource) 
- and the `--use-remote-relative-includes` option is specified

then the final path to the include file is a concatenation of the path to the processed file and the path in the include. If the file is not found there, *Builder* reports an error.

##### Examples: #####
```
The processed file: "https://example.com/folderA/folderB/somefile.nut"

It contains:
@include "anotherfile.nut"

The final path to the include: "https://example.com/folderA/folderB/anotherfile.nut"
```

```
The processed file: "github:someuser/somerepo/folderA/folderB/somefile.nut@v1.2.3"

It contains:
@include "folderC/anotherfile.nut"

The final path to the include: "github:someuser/somerepo/folderA/folderB/folderC/anotherfile.nut@v1.2.3"
```

### Relative Path To Local File ###

If

- the path in the include is a relative path 
- and the processed file is a local file (or it is a remote file but the `--use-remote-relative-includes` option is not specified) 

then *Builder* makes the following steps to find the include file:

1. Only if the processed file is a local file, the final path to the include file is a concatenation of the path to the processed file and the path in the include. If the file is not found there, moves to the next step.
1. The final path to the include file is a concatenation of the path to the file specified as the `<input_file>` parameter of the `pleasebuild` command and the path in the include. If the file is not found there, moves to the next step.
1. The final path to the include file is a concatenation of the path to the directory from where the `pleasebuild` command has been called and the path in the include. If the file is not found there, *Builder* reports an error.

##### Examples: #####
```
The processed file: "/home/user/someuser/folderA/somefile.ext"

It contains:
@include "folderX/anotherfile.nut"

The "pleasebuild" command is called from: "/home/user/someuser/folderB"
With the <input_file> parameter: "folderC/initialfile.nut"

The anotherfile.nut file will be searched sequentially in the following locations:
1. "/home/user/someuser/folderA/folderX/"
2. "/home/user/someuser/folderB/folderC/folderX/"
3. "/home/user/someuser/folderB/folderX/"
```

## Remote Include Files ##

### Supported Remote Resources ###

*Builder* supports file includes from the following types of remote resources:

#### HTTP/HTTPs Server ####

For includes from weblinks.

##### Format: #####
```
@include "http://<server>[:<port>]/<path>"
@include "https://<server>[:<port>]/<path>"
@include once "http://<server>[:<port>]/<path>"
@include once "https://<server>[:<port>]/<path>"
```
where:
- `server` is the host name or IP address.
- `port` is the port number.
- `path` is the path to file.

##### Examples: #####
```
@include "https://example.com/somefile.ext"
@include once "http://example.com/folderA/folderB/somefile.nut"
```

##### Root of the remote resource: #####
```
http://<server>:<port>
https://<server>:<port>
```

#### GitHub Repository ####

For includes from [github.com](https://github.com).

##### Format: #####
```
@include "github:<user>/<repo>/<path>[@<ref>]"
@include once "github:<user>/<repo>/<path>[@<ref>]"
```
where:
- `user` is the user/organization name.
- `repo` is the repository name.
- `path` is the path to file.
- `ref` is the git reference (branch name or tag, defaults to _master_).

##### Examples: #####
```
@include "github:electricimp/Promise/promise.class.nut" // head of the default branch
@include "github:electricimp/Promise/promise.class.nut@develop" // head of the develop branch
@include once "github:electricimp/Promise/promise.class.nut@v3.0.1" // tag v3.0.1
```

##### Root of the remote resource: #####
```
github:<user>/<repo>
```

##### Authentication: #####

Authentication is optional. It is required to access private repositories only. But please note that when you use authentication, the GitHub API provides much higher rate limits.

For the authentication you need to provide:
- a GitHub username (`--github-user` option)
- a GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) or a password, which is less secure and not recommended (`--github-token` option).

#### Bitbucket Server Repository ####

For includes from [Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download). **Note**, this is not the same as Bitbucket Cloud, includes from [Bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/) are not supported.

*Builder* can work with only one Bitbucket server at a time. Its address must be specified (`--bitbucket-server-addr` option). Server version **5.3.0** or above is supported.

##### Format: #####
```
@include "bitbucket-server:<project>/<repo>/<path>[@<ref>]"
@include "bitbucket-server:~<user>/<repo>/<path>[@<ref>]"
@include once "bitbucket-server:<project>/<repo>/<path>[@<ref>]"
@include once "bitbucket-server:~<user>/<repo>/<path>[@<ref>]"
```
where:
- `project` is the project name. Should be used to include files from project repositories.
- `user` is the user name. Should be used to include files from personal repositories. **Note**, the user name must be prepended with `~`. Eg, for the user name John it should be `~john`.
- `repo` is the repository name.
- `path` is the path to file.
- `ref` is the git reference (branch name or tag, defaults to _master_).

##### Examples: #####
```
@include "bitbucket-server:Tools/Promise/promise.class.nut" // head of the default branch
@include once "bitbucket-server:Tools/Promise/promise.class.nut@develop" // head of the develop branch
@include "bitbucket-server:~john/Promise/promise.class.nut@v3.0.1" // tag v3.0.1
```

##### Root of the remote resource: #####
```
bitbucket-server:<project>/<repo>
bitbucket-server:~<user>/<repo>
```

##### Authentication: #####

Authentication is optional. It is required to access private repositories only.

For the authentication you need to provide:
- a Bitbucket Server username (`--bitbucket-server-user` option)
- a Bitbucket Server [personal access token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html) or a password, which is less secure and not recommended (`--bitbucket-server-token` option).

#### Azure Repository ####

For includes from [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/).

##### Format: #####
```
@include "git-azure-repos:<org>/<project>/<repo>/<path>[@<ref>]"
@include once "git-azure-repos:<org>/<project>/<repo>/<path>[@<ref>]"
```
where:
- `org` is the organization name.
- `project` is the project name.
- `repo` is the repository name.
- `path` is the path to file.
- `ref` is the git reference (branch name or tag, defaults to _master_).

##### Examples: #####
```
@include once "git-azure-repos:org/project/repo/path/some.class.nut" // head of the default branch
@include "git-azure-repos:org/project/repo/path/some.class.nut@develop" // head of the develop branch
@include "git-azure-repos:org/project/repo/path/some.class.nut@v3.0.1" // tag v3.0.1
```

##### Root of the remote resource: #####
```
git-azure-repos:<org>/<project>/<repo>
```

##### Authentication: #####

Authentication is optional. It is required to access private repositories only.

For the authentication you need to provide:
- an Azure Repos username (`--azure-user` option)
- an Azure Repos personal access token (`--azure-token` option).

#### Local Git Repository ####

For includes from Git repositories hosted locally. **Note**, even as files are local, *Builder* considers them as files from a remote resource when [searching the file to include](#searching-the-included-file).

##### Format: #####
```
@include "git-local:<path>[@<ref>]"
@include once "git-local:<path>[@<ref>]"
```
where:
- `path` is the path to file.
- `ref` is the git reference (branch name, tag or commit, defaults to current branch which the local git repository is set to).

##### Examples: #####
```
@include once "git-local:/path/to/repo/and/file/some.class.nut" // head of the default branch
@include once "git-local:/path/to/repo/and/file/some.class.nut@develop" // head of the develop branch
@include "git-local:/path/to/repo/and/file/some.class.nut@3.0.1" // tag v3.0.1
@include "git-local:/path/to/repo/and/file/some.class.nut@c13c59e96f3f6a37f75f9e520d0fdc5591e0ba83" // concrete commit
```

##### Root of the remote resource: #####
Is determined by *Builder*.

##### Notes: #####
- [Caching](#caching-remote-files) is not applicable to local Git files.
- If there are uncommitted changes, they will not be seen by *Builder*. Hence `@include "git-local:<path>"` (without `<ref>`) is not interchangeable with `@include "<path>"`.
- There are local and remote branches in Git. If you want to create a local remote-tracking branch from a remote branch, you can use, for example, the `git checkout <remote_branch_name>` command. For more info, see the [Git docs](https://git-scm.com/).
- To include a remote git branch, you should specify the name of the remote repository in the `ref` part of the directive. For example:
```
@include "git-local:/path/to/repo/and/file/some.class.nut@develop" // include local git branch
@include "git-local:/path/to/repo/and/file/some.class.nut@origin/develop" // include remote git branch from the "origin" remote repository
```

### Caching Remote Files ###

To reduce compilation time, *Builder* can optionally cache files included from a remote resource. If the file cache is enabled, remote files are cached locally in the `.builder-cache` directory. Cached resources expire and are automatically invalidated 24 hours after their addition to the cache.

To turn the cache on, pass the `--cache` or `-c` option to *Builder*. If this option is not specified, *Builder* will not use the file cache even if the cached data exists and is valid &mdash; *Builder* will continue to query remote resources on every execution.

To reset the cache, use both the `--cache` and the `--clear-cache` options.

If a resource should never be cached, it needs to be added to the `exclude-list.builder` file (see the example below). You can use wildcard characters to mask file names.

#### Wildcard Pattern Matching ####

Pattern matching syntax is a similar to that of *.gitignore*. A string is a wildcard pattern if it contains '```?```' or '```*```' characters. Empty strings or strings that starts with '```#```' are ignored.

A '```?```' symbol matches any single character. For example, `bo?t.js` matches `boot.js` and `boat.js`, but doesn't match `bot.js`.

A '```*```' matches any string, that is limited by slashes, including the empty string. For example, ```/foo/*ar``` matches `/foo/bar`, `/foo/ar` and `/foo/foo-bar`, but doesn't match `/foo/get/bar` or `/foo/bar/get`.

Two consecutive asterisks `**` in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:

* A leading `**` followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, `**/foo` matches file or directory `foo` anywhere, the same as pattern `foo`. `**/foo/bar` matches file or directory `bar` anywhere that is directly under directory `foo`.

* A trailing `/**` matches everything inside. For example, `abc/**` matches all files inside directory `abc`.

* A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example, `a/**/b` matches `a/b`, `a/x/b`, `a/x/y/b` and so on.

* Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.

##### Examples: #####

```sh
# Avoid caching a specific file
github:electricimp/MessageManager/MessageManager.lib.nut

# Exclude all electricimp repos
github:electicimp/**

# Exclude all tagged files or files from the specific branches from the cache
github:*/**/*@*
```

### Saving And Reusing Versions Of Remote Files ###

It is possible to save the versions of all remote files which are used during the current run of *Builder*, and reuse exactly that versions later. This is applicable for files from repositories only.

See the [Repository Files: Dependencies](#repository-files-dependencies) section for the details.

### Proxy Access To Remote Files ###

To specify a proxy that should be used when you are including files from remote resources, set the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`/`http_proxy` and/or `HTTPS_PROXY`/`https_proxy` for HTTP and HTTPS protocols respectively.

For example, to operate through a proxy running at IP address `192.168.10.2` on port `3128` for HTTP requests, you should set the environment variable: `HTTP_PROXY='http://192.168.10.2:3128'`. All of *Builder’s* HTTP requests will now go through the proxy.

# Advanced Builder Usage #

This section contains information that will help you work with Builder more effectively, but may not be needed for more basic Builder tasks.

## Reproducible Artifacts ##

It is possible to save the build configuration data used for preprocessing a source file in order to create an identical source file again later with that saved configuration. Builder variable definitions are saved in a [‘directives.json’](#builder-variables-directives) file, and references to the concrete versions of [repository](#remote-include-files) files and libraries are stored in a [‘dependencies.json’](#repository-files-dependencies) file.

### Builder Variables: Directives ###

The `--save-directives [<path_to_file>]` and `--use-directives [<path_to_file>]` options are used to, respectively, save and reuse Builder variable definitions. The definitions are saved in a JSON file. If a file name is not specified, the `directives.json` file in the local directory is used. These options are processed the similar way as the `--save-dependencies` and `--use-dependencies` options, above.

When the `--use-directives [<path_to_file>]` option is used, the saved Builder variable definitions are merged with definitions specified by `-D<variable> <value>` options.

A typical `directives.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "Variable0": "value0",
  "Variable1": "value1"
}
```

### Repository Files: Dependencies ###

`--save-dependencies [<path_to_file>]` and `--use-dependencies [<path_to_file>]` options are used to save and to reuse, respectively, references to concrete versions of [repository](#remote-include-files) files and libraries. The references are saved in a JSON file. If a file name is not specified, the `dependencies.json` file in the local directory is used. Every reference consists of [repository](#remote-include-files) file URL and:
- Git Blob ID (Git Blob SHA) &mdash; for GitHub files<br>
**Note** It is possible to obtain the Git Blob ID of a GitHub file using the following *git* command: `git hash-object <path_to_file>`
- Git Commit ID (Git Commit SHA) &mdash; for Bitbucket Server, Azure Repos and Git Local files

For more information, please see [the Git Manual](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) and [the Git API](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/blobs/).

These options are processed the following way:

- If only `--save-dependencies [<path_to_file>]` is specified, the references to all source files retrieved from [repositories](#remote-include-files) are saved in the provided JSON file (or `dependencies.json`).
- If only `--use-dependencies [<path_to_file>]` is specified, the source files from [repositories](#remote-include-files) are retrieved using the references read from the provided JSON file (or `dependencies.json`).
- If both `--save-dependencies [<path_to_file>]` and `--use-dependencies [<path_to_file>]` are specified, then:
    1. The source files from [repositories](#remote-include-files) are retrieved using the references read from the JSON file passed to the `--use-dependencies` option (or `dependencies.json`).
    2. If the source code contains @includes for files from [repositories](#remote-include-files) which have not yet been retrieved, they are retrieved now.
    3. Builder performs the preprocessing operation.
    4. References to all source files retrieved from [repositories](#remote-include-filesl) are saved in the JSON file passed to the `--save-dependencies` option (or `dependencies.json`).

**Note** If `--save-dependencies` is specified, the `--cache` option is ignored. If `--use-dependencies` is specified, the `--cache` option does not affect the files referenced in the dependency file.

A typical `dependencies.json` file looks like this:

```json
[
  [
    "github:ProjectA/repositoryA/fileA",
    "2ff017dc92e826ad184f9cdeadd1a2446f8d6032"
  ],
  [
    "github:ProjectB/repositoryB/fileB",
    "a01b64f9ce764f226f52c6b9364396d4a8bd550b"
  ],
  [
    "bitbucket-server:projectC/repositoryC/fileC",
    "4bc4024f1f2ad99e8bd2ade73d151912e031d1f5"
  ],
  [
    "git-azure-repos:org/projectD/repositoryD/fileD",
    "d1ccee9ed6e250c6d5e1f052107125659d3ba9d0"
  ],
  [
    "git-local:/path/to/repo/and/fileD",
    "c13c59e96f3f6a37f75f9e520d0fdc5591e0ba83"
  ]
]
```

## Including JavaScript Libraries ##

Builder can accept JavaScript libraries to add functionality to its global namespace. The library should export an object, the properties of which will be merged into the global namespace. For example, to include a function, *upper()*, to convert strings to uppercase, define your library file like so:

```js
module.exports = {
    upper: (s) => s.toUpperCase()
};
```

Now include the function within directives in your input file:

```
@{upper("warning:")}
@{upper(include("warning.txt"))}
```

Finally, run Builder with the option `--lib path/to/your/lib/file`.

### Binding The Context Object Correctly ###

Functions called by Builder will be called with their *this* argument set to a Builder context object. Within the context object, Builder [variables](#variables) like `__FILE__`, [functions](#builder-functions) like `max()`, and other included library functions will be made available at the top level. Variables defined in your input code with `@macro` or `@set` will be available under the key *globals*.

Ignoring the binding of *this* may cause unexpected behavior, for example when calling methods on objects. Take the following example library:

```js
class MyClass {
    constructor(str) {
        this._str = str;
    }

    getStr() {
        return this._str;
    }
}

myObject = MyClass("my text");

module.exports = {
    myObject
};
```

Attempting to use this library with the directive `@{myObject.getStr()}` will not deliver the expected behavior because *this* in *getStr()* will be set to a Builder context object and not to *myObject*. When calling class methods ensure they have been bound to the correct value of *this*:

```js
class MyClass {
    constructor(str) {
        this._str = str;
    }

    getStr() {
        return this._str;
    }
}

myObject = MyClass("my text");

module.exports = {
    getStr: myObject.getStr.bind(myObject)
};
```

# Testing #

When running tests locally, please test on both Windows and macOS. All environment variables are optional. However, if you are working with `@includes` from GitHub and do not provide GitHub credentials, rate limits imposed by GitHub may cause test failures. The default for `SPEC_LOGLEVEL` is `error`.

```sh
npm install
SPEC_LOGLEVEL=<debug|info|warning|error>
SPEC_GITHUB_USERNAME=<GitHub username>
SPEC_GITHUB_TOKEN=<GitHub password/access token>
npm test
```

**Note 1**: The standard set of tests doesn't include Bitbucket Server, Azure Repos and Git Local (but see the **Note 2**) integration testing. To run Bitbucket Server, Azure Repos or Git Local tests, please see the sections below.

**Note 2**: The standard set of tests uses Git Local in several tests for testing the overall behavior of Builder. They require the `SPEC_GIT_LOCAL_REPO_PATH` variable to be set (see the [Git Local](#git-local) section below). These are optional tests so they will be skipped if that variable is not set.

**Note 3**: There are several tests that require access to the root of the filesystem (or to the root of the disk `C:` on Windows). They will create/remove there a directory named `builder_test_g2e5r6uh`, so please make sure you don't have some important data in such directory.
